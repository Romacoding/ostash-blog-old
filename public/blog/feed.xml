Let’s not go into details on its specific implementation (hopefully the reader is familiar with it. If not, there are plenty of resources online to read upon this topic).  With years passed you grow, you change, so as your code. I order to satisfy the need of learning,  you are starting to look into other concepts, other programming styles and ideas.
