I'm a self-taught Web Developer. I love to code and to build Web Applications. I have an experience in Front and Back End Web Development. I'm a quick learner and a team player.
Thinking outside of the box, problem solving skills and perseverance in achieving my goals are helping me in my personal and professional development.
