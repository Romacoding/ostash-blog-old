### The jorney begins

Like many of developers that were coding for the last few years, I was following mostly object oriented programming paradigm. Let’s not go into details on its specific implementation (hopefully the reader is familiar with it. If not, there are plenty of resources online to read upon this topic).
With years passed you grow, you change, so as your code. I order to satisfy the need of learning, you are starting to look into other concepts, other programming styles and ideas.
Being little skeptical at first, I did follow the advice of my good friend to look into Clojure. A language of pure functions, immutability and parentheses.
This blog will follow my journey of diving into the deep ocean of functional programming.
