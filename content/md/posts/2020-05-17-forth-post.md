<div style="text-align: justify">
**Currying** is an act of taking one function that receives more than one argument and refactoring it so it becomes **HOF**(a higher order function) that returns series of functions each accepting only one argument and only evaluating once we receive our final argument.<br/> 
The act of currying can be described as taking a multiary function and turning it into series of unary functions.
